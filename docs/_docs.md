### Documentation

Use this directory to keep all of the code documentation in markdown files.

Avoid adding big blocks of comments to the code by adding the documentation to this directory.
Reference the document path / name in the code instead.

Each significant feature should have its own document.

**Keep all documentation well-structured, clear and concise.**
